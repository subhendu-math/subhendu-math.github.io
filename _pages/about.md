I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher at TU Dresden**, working with  **[Prof. Marc Timme](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/cfnd-about)**. My work is situated at the interface of nonlinear dynamics and complex networks, with a focus on understanding collective behavior and resilience in complex systems.

Previously, I held a postdoctoral position at the **University of Zurich**, working with  **[Prof. Jordi Bascompte](https://www.bascompte.net/)**. There, I studied ecological and mutualistic networks, with particular emphasis on collapse, recovery, and the role of network structure in shaping system stability.

I completed my **PhD at IIT Ropar** under the supervision of  **[Prof. Partha Sarathi Dutta](https://mathbio.iitrpr.ac.in/)**. My doctoral research examined critical transitions and early warning signals in ecological and spatially structured networks, combining dynamical systems theory with large-scale numerical modeling.

Prior to my PhD, I studied at **IIT Guwahati** and **Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur (Kolkata)**,developing a strong background in mathematics and theoretical sciences.


I come from **Kamarpukur, West Bengal, India**—a small village known as the birthplace of **Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa**—which has shaped my curiosity and appreciation for the interplay between simplicity and complexity.
My research lies at the intersection of **nonlinear dynamics, complex networks, and theoretical ecology**. I study collapse–recovery dynamics, critical transitions, and early warning signals in mutualistic and spatially structured systems, with a particular interest in how local interaction patterns and global spatial organization together determine resilience and persistence in complex networks.
