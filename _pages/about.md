I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher at TU Dresden**, working with  
**[Prof. Marc Timme](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/cfnd-about)**, where my research focuses on nonlinear dynamics and complex networks.

Previously, I held a postdoctoral position at the **University of Zurich** in the **[Bascompte Lab](https://www.bascompte.net/)**, working with  
**[Prof. Jordi Bascompte](https://www.bascompte.net/)** on ecological and mutualistic networks and their resilience properties.

I completed my **PhD at IIT Ropar** under the supervision of  
**[Prof. Partha Sarathi Dutta](https://mathbio.iitrpr.ac.in/)**, where my doctoral research examined collapse, recovery, and critical transitions in ecological and spatially structured networks using dynamical systems and network-based modeling.

Before my PhD, I studied at **IIT Guwahati** and **Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur (Kolkata)**, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics and theoretical sciences.

I come from **Kamarpukur, West Bengal, India**—a small village known as the birthplace of **Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa**—which has shaped my curiosity and appreciation for the interplay between simplicity and complexity.

I am a theoretical and computational researcher with training in applied mathematics and complex systems.

My research lies at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics, complex networks, and theoretical ecology. I study collapse and recovery, critical transitions, and early warning signals in mutualistic and spatially structured systems, using dynamical systems theory, network structure, and numerical modeling. My work focuses on understanding how local interaction patterns and global spatial organization shape resilience and persistence in complex ecological networks.
